# Establishment of payment

Before initiating the payment gateway, it is necessary to establish the payment. In effect of calling, we repeat parameters of the payment including the parameter ```gw_url```, which you can initiate to [inline](#inline-option) or [redirect](#redirect-option) payment gateway.  
   
The payee of the payment is identified by ```goid``` in object [target](##target). You can get it, when you integrate the payment gateway for identification of specific point of sale, e.g. [www.goshop.cz](http://www.goshop.cz).
<aside class='notice'>
If you do not have GoID, contact us on e-mail integrace@gopay.cz. 
</aside>  
Within the payment, the paying party is described by an object [payer](##payer),  
which identifies the payer and determines the set of permitted payment method,  
including the default method. 

## Standard payment

The payment is determined for paying of an order by credit card, bank transfer, GoPay account and other payment methods.
